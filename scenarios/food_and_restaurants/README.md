# Recommendation systems for Food and Restaurants

Recommendation systems play a crucial role in the food service industry, from restaurant discovery platforms to food delivery apps. Studies show that personalized recommendations can increase order values by [up to 20%](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-future-of-personalization-and-how-to-get-ready-for-it) in food delivery services.

## Scenarios

Here are the key scenarios and considerations for food and restaurant recommendations.

### Restaurant discovery

This scenario helps users discover new restaurants based on their dining history, preferences, and context (location, time, occasion). Collaborative filtering approaches like [ALS](../../examples/00_quick_start/als_movielens.ipynb) and [NCF](../../examples/00_quick_start/ncf_movielens.ipynb) can be adapted for this purpose.

### Menu item recommendations

When a user is browsing a restaurant's menu, the system recommends dishes based on their past orders, dietary preferences, and popular combinations. This can include personalized recommendations and "frequently ordered together" suggestions.

### Meal planning and recipe recommendations

For meal planning apps, the system suggests recipes based on dietary restrictions, nutritional goals, and ingredient availability. Content-based filtering approaches are particularly useful here.

### Time-sensitive recommendations

This involves recommending different options based on time of day, day of week, or special occasions. For example, suggesting breakfast places in the morning or romantic restaurants for anniversary dinners.

## Data and evaluation

Key data sources include user profiles (dietary preferences, allergies), order history, restaurant attributes (cuisine type, price range, location), menu items, and contextual data (time, weather, special occasions).

Common evaluation metrics include order conversion rate, average order value, and customer satisfaction ratings. [A/B testing](../../GLOSSARY.md) is crucial for measuring the impact of recommendations on business metrics.

## Other considerations

Food and restaurant recommendations must account for various constraints including dietary restrictions, food allergies, delivery radius, restaurant capacity, and real-time availability. Seasonal menus and time-sensitive offerings also need to be considered in the recommendation strategy.
