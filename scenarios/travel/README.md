# Recommendation systems for Travel

Recommendation systems are vital in the modern travel industry, helping users navigate through countless options for destinations, accommodations, and activities. Studies show that personalized recommendations can increase customer engagement by [up to 30%](https://mize.tech/blog/ai-in-tourism-marketing-hyper-personalization-and-more-bookings/) in travel platforms.

## Scenarios

Here are the key scenarios and considerations for travel recommendations.

### Destination discovery

This scenario helps users discover travel destinations based on their preferences, past trips, budget constraints, and seasonal factors. Both collaborative filtering approaches like [ALS](../../examples/00_quick_start/als_movielens.ipynb) and content-based methods can be used to match travelers with destinations.

### Accommodation recommendations

When a user has selected a destination, the system recommends hotels, vacation rentals, or other accommodations based on their preferences (price range, amenities, location) and similar users' choices. Models like [NCF](../../examples/00_quick_start/ncf_movielens.ipynb) and [SAR](../../examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb) can be adapted for this purpose.

### Activity and experience suggestions

This involves recommending tours, attractions, and activities at a chosen destination based on user interests, time of year, and duration of stay. Content-based filtering and hybrid approaches are particularly effective here.

### Trip planning assistance

This scenario helps users build complete itineraries by suggesting complementary items (flights, accommodations, activities) that work well together. Sequential recommendation approaches can be particularly useful for building coherent travel plans.

## Data and evaluation

Key data sources include user profiles (preferences, past bookings), item attributes (destinations, hotels, activities), contextual data (seasonality, weather, events), and user-generated content (reviews, ratings).

Common evaluation metrics include booking conversion rate, average booking value, and customer satisfaction scores. [A/B testing](../../GLOSSARY.md) is essential for measuring the impact of recommendations on business metrics.

## Other considerations

Travel recommendations must account for numerous constraints including seasonality, availability, pricing dynamics, and booking windows. Additionally, recommendations should consider factors like group travel needs, special occasions, and the high-stakes nature of travel decisions. Local regulations, visa requirements, and travel restrictions also need to be factored into the recommendation strategy.
