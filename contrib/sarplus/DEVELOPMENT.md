# Packaging

For [databricks](https://databricks.com/) to properly install a [C++ extension](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/building.html), one must take a detour through [pypi](https://pypi.org/).
Use [twine](https://github.com/pypa/twine) to upload the package to [pypi](https://pypi.org/).

```bash
cd python

python setup.py sdist

twine upload dist/pysarplus-*.tar.gz
```

On [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) one can install all 3 components (C++, Python, Scala) in one pass by creating a [Spark Package](https://spark-packages.org/). Documentation is rather sparse. Steps to install

1. Package and publish the [pip package](python/setup.py) (see above)
2. Package the [Spark package](scala/build.sbt), which includes the [Scala formatter](scala/src/main/scala/microsoft/sarplus) and references the [pip package](scala/python/requirements.txt) (see below)
3. Upload the zipped Scala package to [Spark Package](https://spark-packages.org/) through a browser. [sbt spPublish](https://github.com/databricks/sbt-spark-package) has a few [issues](https://github.com/databricks/sbt-spark-package/issues/31) so it always fails for me. Don't use spPublishLocal as the packages are not created properly (names don't match up, [issue](https://github.com/databricks/sbt-spark-package/issues/17)) and furthermore fail to install if published to [Spark-Packages.org](https://spark-packages.org/).  

```bash
cd scala
sbt spPublish
```

# Testing

To test the python UDF + C++ backend

```bash
cd python 
python setup.py install && pytest -s tests/
```

To test the Scala formatter

```bash
cd scala
sbt test
```

(use ~test and it will automatically check for changes in source files, but not build.sbt)
