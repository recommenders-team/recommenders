    "Factorization machine (FM) is one of the representative algorithms that are used for building content-based recommenders model. The algorithm is powerful in terms of capturing the effects of not just the input features but also their interactions. The algorithm provides better generalization capability and expressiveness compared to other classic algorithms such as SVMs. The most recent research extends the basic FM algorithms by using deep learning techniques, which achieve remarkable improvement in a few practical use cases.\n",

The algorithm was original proposed in [\\[1\\]](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf). Traditionally, the algorithms such as SVM do not perform well in dealing with highly sparse data that is usually seen in many contemporary problems, e.g., click-through rate prediction, recommendation, etc. FM handles the problem by modeling not just first-order linear components for predicting the label, but also the cross-product of the feature variables in order to capture more generalized correlation between variables and label.

    "More advanced tuning methods like Bayesian Optimization can be used for searching for the optimal model efficiently. The benefit of using, for example, `HyperDrive` from Azure Machine Learning Services, for tuning the parameters, is that, the tuning tasks can be distributed across nodes of a cluster and the optimization can be run concurrently to save the total cost.\n",

The Docker file provided [here](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/master/docker) can be used for such purpose."
