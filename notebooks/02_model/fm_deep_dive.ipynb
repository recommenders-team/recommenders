    "\n",
    "Factorization machine (FM) is one of the representative algorithms that are used for building content-based recommender model. The algorithm is powerful in terms of capturing the high-order interactions between input features. In addition, it provides better generalization capability and expressiveness compared to the other classic algorithms such as SVM. The most recent research extends the basic FM algorithms by using deep learning techniques, which achieve remarkable improvement in a few practical use cases.\n",

    "FM is an algorithm that uses factorization in prediction tasks with data set of high sparsity. The algorithm was original proposed in [here](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf). Traditionally, the algorithms such as SVM failed in dealing with highly sparse data that is usually seen in many contemporary problems, e.g., click-through rate prediction, recommendation, etc. FM handles the problem by modeling not just first-order linear components for predicting the label, but also the cross-product of the feature variables in order to capture more generalized correlation between variables and label.

    "More advanced tuning methods like Bayesian Optimization can be used for searching for the optimal model efficiently. The benefit of using, for example, `HyperDrive` from Azure Machine Learning Services, for tuning the parameters, is that, the tuning tasks can be distributed across nodes of a cluster and the optimization can be run concurrently to save the total cost.\n",

    "* Details about how to tune hyper parameters by using Azure Machine Learning Services can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/master/notebooks/04_model_select_and_optimize).\n",
    "* Note, to enable the tuning task on Azure Machine Learning Services by using HyperDrive, one needs a Docker image to containerize the environment where `xlearn` can be run. The Docker file provided [here](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/master/docker) can be used for such purpose."
