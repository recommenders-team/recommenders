    "\n",
    "This figure shows how to utilize latent vectors of items and users, and then how to fuse outputs from GMF Layer (left) and MLP Layer (right). We will introduce this framework and show how to learn the model parameters in following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The GMF model\n",
    "\n",
    "In ALS, the ratings are modeled as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat { r } _ { u , i } = q _ { i } ^ { T } p _ { u }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "GMF introduces neural CF layer as the output layer of standard MF. In this way, MF can be easily generalized\n",
    "and extended. For example, if we allow the edge weights of this output layer to be learnt from data without the uniform constraint, it will result in a variant of MF that allows varying importance of latent dimensions. And if we use a non-linear function for activation, it will generalize MF to a non-linear setting which might be more expressive than the linear MF model. GMF can be shown as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat { r } _ { u , i } = a _ { o u t } \\left( h ^ { T } \\left( q _ { i } \\odot p _ { u } \\right) \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\odot$ is element-wise product of vectors. Additionally, ${a}_{out}$ and ${h}$ denote the activation function and edge weights of the output layer respectively. MF can be interpreted as a special case of GMF. Intuitively, if we use an identity function for aout and enforce h to be a uniform vector of 1, we can exactly recover the MF model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The MLP model\n",
    "\n",
    "NCF adopts two pathways to model users and items: 1) element-wise product of vectors, 2) concatenation of vectors. To learn interactions after concatenating of users and items latent features, the standard MLP model is applied. In this sense, we can endow the model a large level of flexibility and non-linearity to learn the interactions between $p_{u}$ and $q_{i}$. The details of MLP model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input layer, there is concatention of user and item vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z _ { 1 } = \\phi _ { 1 } \\left( p _ { u } , q _ { i } \\right) = \\left[ \\begin{array} { c } { p _ { u } } \\\\ { q _ { i } } \\end{array} \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So for the hidden layers and output layer of MLP, the details are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\phi _ { l } \\left( z _ { l } \\right) = a _ { o u t } \\left( W _ { l } ^ { T } z _ { l } + b _ { l } \\right) , ( l = 2,3 , \\ldots , L - 1 )\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat { r } _ { u , i } = \\sigma \\left( h ^ { T } \\phi \\left( z _ { L - 1 } \\right) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ${ W }_{ l }$, ${ b }_{ l }$, and ${ a }_{ out }$ denote the weight matrix, bias vector, and activation function for the $l$-th layer’s perceptron, respectively. For activation functions of MLP layers, one can freely choose sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and Rectifier (ReLU), among others. Because of binary data task, the activation function of the output layer is defined as sigmoid $\\sigma(x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ to restrict the predicted score to be in (0,1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Fusion of GMF and MLP\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide more flexibility to the fused model, we allow GMF and MLP to learn separate embeddings, and combine the two models by concatenating their last hidden layer. We get $\\phi^{GMF}$ from GMF:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi _ { u , i } ^ { G M F } = p _ { u } ^ { G M F } \\odot q _ { i } ^ { G M F }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and obtain $\\phi^{MLP}$ from MLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi _ { u , i } ^ { M L P } = a _ { o u t } \\left( W _ { L } ^ { T } \\left( a _ { o u t } \\left( \\ldots a _ { o u t } \\left( W _ { 2 } ^ { T } \\left[ \\begin{array} { c } { p _ { u } ^ { M L P } } \\\\ { q _ { i } ^ { M L P } } \\end{array} \\right] + b _ { 2 } \\right) \\ldots \\right) \\right) + b _ { L }\\right.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we fuse output from GMF and MLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat { r } _ { u , i } = \\sigma \\left( h ^ { T } \\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { \\phi ^ { G M F } } \\\\ { \\phi ^ { M L P } } \\end{array} \\right] \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model combines the linearity of MF and non-linearity of DNNs for modelling user–item latent structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the likelihood function as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P \\left( \\mathcal { R } , \\mathcal { R } ^ { - } | \\mathbf { P } , \\mathbf { Q } , \\Theta \\right) = \\prod _ { ( u , i ) \\in \\mathcal { R } } \\hat { r } _ { u , i } \\prod _ { ( u , j ) \\in \\mathcal { R } ^{ - } } \\left( 1 - \\hat { r } _ { u , j } \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mathcal{R}$ denotes the set of observed interactions, and $\\mathcal{ R } ^ { - }$ denotes the set of negative instances. $\\mathbf{P}$ and $\\mathbf{Q}$ denotes the latent factor matrix for users and items, respectively; and $\\Theta$ denotes the model parameters. Taking the negative logarithm of the likelihood, we obatain the objective function to minimize for NCF method, which is known as [binary cross-entropy loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = - \\sum _ { ( u , i ) \\in \\mathcal { R } \\cup { \\mathcal { R } } ^ { - } } r _ { u , i } \\log \\hat { r } _ { u , i } + \\left( 1 - r _ { u , i } \\right) \\log \\left( 1 - \\hat { r } _ { u , i } \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization can be done by performing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which is described in the [Surprise SVD deep dive notebook](../02_model/surprise_svd_deep_dive.ipynb). Our SGD method is very similar to the SVD algorithm's."

Finally, we average the values of those ranked lists to obtain the overall HR and NDCG on test data.\n",

But in this notebook, to compare with other algorithms, we select latest 25% dataset as test data. So this is an artificial \"leave-one-out\" evaluation only showing how to use `test_loader` and how to calculate metrics like the original paper.
