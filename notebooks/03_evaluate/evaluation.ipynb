In the context of recommendation system, rating metrics are to evaluate how accurate a recommender is to predict ratings that users may give to items. Therefore, the metrics are **calculated exactly on the same group of (user, item) pairs that exist in both ground-truth dataset and prediction dataset** and **averaged by the total number of users**.\n",

    "\"Beyond-accuray evaluation\" was proposed to evaluate how relevant recommendations are for users. In this case, a recommendation system is a treated as a ranking system. Given a relency definition, recommendation system outputs a list of recommended items to each user, which is ordered by relevance. The evaluation part takes ground-truth data, the actual items that users interact with (e.g., liked, purchased, etc.), and the recommendation data, as inputs, to calculate ranking evaluation metrics. \n",

    "#### 2.2.1 Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Ranking metrics are often used when hit and/or ranking of the items are considered:\n",
    "* **Hit** - defined by relevancy, a hit usually means whether the recommended \"k\" items hit the \"relevant\" items by the user. For example, a user may have clicked, viewed, or purchased an item for many times, and a hit in the recommended items indicate that the recommender performs well. Metrics like \"precision\", \"recall\", etc. measure the performance of such hitting accuracy.\n",
    "* **Ranking** - ranking metrics give more explanations about, for the hitted items, whether they are ranked in a way that is preferred by the users whom the items will be recommended to. Metrics like \"mean average precision\", \"ndcg\", etc., evaluate whether the relevant items are ranked higher than the less-relevant or irrelevant items. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 How-to with evaluation utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes about the interface of the Rating evaluator class:\n",
    "1. The columns of user, item, and rating (prediction) should be present in the ground-truth DataFrame (prediction DataFrame). The column of timestamp is optional, but it is required if certain relevanc function is used. For example, timestamps will be used if the most recent items are defined as the relevant one.\n",
    "2. There should be no duplicates of (user, item) pairs in the ground-truth and the prediction DataFrames, othewise there may be unexpected behavior in calculating certain metrics.\n",
    "3. Default column names for user, item, rating, and prediction are \"UserId\", \"ItemId\", \"Rating\", and \"Prediciton\", respectively."
