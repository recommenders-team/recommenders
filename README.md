## What's New (April, 2025)

We reached 20,000 stars!!

We are happy to announce that we have reached 20,000 stars on GitHub! Thank you for your support and contributions to the Recommenders project. We are excited to continue building and improving this project with your help.

Check out the release [Recommenders 1.2.1](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/releases/tag/1.2.1)!

We fixed a lot of bugs due to dependencies, improved security, reviewed the notebooks and the libraries.

## Introduction

Recommenders objective is to assist researchers, developers and enthusiasts in prototyping, experimenting with and bringing to production a range of classic and state-of-the-art recommendation systems.

Recommenders is a project under the [Linux Foundation of AI and Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/). 

This repository contains examples and best practices for building recommendation systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks. The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks:

- [Prepare Data](examples/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommendation algorithm.
- [Model](examples/00_quick_start): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommendation algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).
- [Evaluate](examples/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics.
- [Model Select and Optimize](examples/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommendation models.
- [Operationalize](examples/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure.

Several utilities are provided in [recommenders](recommenders) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [Recommenders documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).

For a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents on the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).

For some of the practical scenarios where recommendation systems have been applied, see [scenarios](scenarios). 

## Getting Started

We recommend [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html?highlight=environment#conda-environment) for environment management, and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. To install the recommenders package and run an example notebook on Linux/WSL:

```bash
# 1. Install gcc if it is not installed already. On Ubuntu, this could done by using the command
# sudo apt install gcc

# 2. Create and activate a new conda environment
conda create -n <environment_name> python=3.9
conda activate <environment_name>

# 3. Install the core recommenders package. It can run all the CPU notebooks.
pip install recommenders

# 4. create a Jupyter kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name <environment_name> --display-name <kernel_name>

# 5. Clone this repo within VSCode or using command line:
git clone https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders.git

# 6. Within VSCode:
#   a. Open a notebook, e.g., examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb;  
#   b. Select Jupyter kernel <kernel_name>;
#   c. Run the notebook.
```

For more information about setup on other platforms (e.g., Windows and macOS) and different configurations (e.g., GPU, Spark and experimental features), see the [Setup Guide](SETUP.md).

In addition to the core package, several extras are also provided, including:
+ `[gpu]`: Needed for running GPU models.
+ `[spark]`: Needed for running Spark models.
+ `[dev]`: Needed for development for the repo.
+ `[all]`: `[gpu]`|`[spark]`|`[dev]`
+ `[experimental]`: Models that are not thoroughly tested and/or may require additional steps in installation.

### Algorithm Comparison

We provide a [benchmark notebook](examples/06_benchmarks/movielens.ipynb) to illustrate how different algorithms could be evaluated and compared. In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode. In this table we show the results on Movielens 100k, running the algorithms for 15 epochs.
