[Microsoft MIND Competition!](https://msnews.github.io/competition.html)

Microsoft is hosting a News Recommendation competition based on the [MIND dataset](https://msnews.github.io/), a large-scale English news dataset with impression logs. Check out the [ACL paper](https://msnews.github.io/assets/doc/ACL2020_MIND.pdf), get familiar with the [news recommendation scenario](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/master/scenarios/news), and dive into the [quick start example](examples/00_quick_start/dkn_MIND_dataset.ipynb) using the DKN algorithm. Then try some other algorthms and tools in recommenders and submit your entry!

This repository contains examples and best practices for building recommendation systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks. The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks: 
- [Prepare Data](examples/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommender algorithm
- [Model](examples/00_quick_start): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommender algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).
- [Evaluate](examples/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics
- [Model Select and Optimize](examples/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommender models
- [Operationalize](examples/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure

Several utilities are provided in [reco_utils](reco_utils) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [reco_utils documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).

For a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents at the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).

## Getting Started

Please see the [setup guide](SETUP.md) for more details on setting up your machine locally, on a [data science virtual machine (DSVM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) or on [Azure Databricks](SETUP.md#setup-guide-for-azure-databricks).

To setup on your local machine:

1. Install Anaconda with Python >= 3.6. [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) is a quick way to get started.

2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders
```

3. Run the generate conda file script to create a conda environment: (This is for a basic python environment, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for PySpark and GPU environment setup)

```
cd Recommenders
python tools/generate_conda_file.py
conda env create -f reco_base.yaml  
```

4. Activate the conda environment and register it with Jupyter:

```
conda activate reco_base
python -m ipykernel install --user --name reco_base --display-name "Python (reco)"
```

5. Start the Jupyter notebook server

```
jupyter notebook
```

6. Run the [SAR Python CPU MovieLens](examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb) notebook under the `00_quick_start` folder. Make sure to change the kernel to "Python (reco)".

**NOTE** - The [Alternating Least Squares (ALS)](examples/00_quick_start/als_movielens.ipynb) notebooks require a PySpark environment to run. Please follow the steps in the [setup guide](SETUP.md#dependencies-setup) to run these notebooks in a PySpark environment. For the deep learning algorithms, it is recommended to use a GPU machine.

### Preliminary Comparison

We provide a [benchmark notebook](benchmarks/movielens.ipynb) to illustrate how different algorithms could be evaluated and compared. In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode. In this table we show the results on Movielens 100k, running the algorithms for 15 epochs.
