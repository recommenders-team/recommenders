    "# Apply Diversity Metrics  \n",
    "## -- Compare ALS and Random Recommenders on MovieLens (PySpark)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to evaluate a recommender using metrics other than commonly used rating/ranking metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such metrics include:\n",
    "- Coverage - We use following two metrics defined by \\[Shani and Gunawardana\\]:\n",
    " \n",
    "    - (1) catalog_coverage, which measures the proportion of items that get recommended from the item catalog; \n",
    "    - (2) distributional_coverage, which measures how equally different items are recommended in the recommendations to all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Novelty - A more novel item indicates it is less popular, i.e. it gets recommended less frequently.\n",
    "We use the definition of novelty from \\[Castells et al.\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diversity - The dissimilarity of items being recommended.\n",
    "We use a definition based on _intralist similarity_ by \\[Zhang et al.]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Serendipity - The \"unusualness\" or \"surprise\" of recommendations to a user.\n",
    "We use a definition based on cosine similarity by \\[Zhang et al.]\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the results obtained with two approaches: using the ALS recommender algorithm vs. a baseline of random recommendations. \n",
    " - Matrix factorization by [ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS) (Alternating Least Squares) is a well known collaborative filtering algorithm.\n",
    " - We also define a process which randomly recommends unseen items to each user. \n",
    " - We show two options to calculate item-item similarity: (1) based on item co-occurrence count; and (2) based on item feature vectors.\n",
    " \n",
    "The comparision results show that the ALS recommender outperforms the random recommender on ranking metrics (Precision@k, Recall@k, NDCG@k, and\tMean average precision), while the random recommender outperforms ALS recommender on diversity metrics. This is because ALS is optimized for estimating the item rating as accurate as possible, therefore it performs well on accuracy metrics including rating and ranking metrics. As a side effect, the items being recommended tend to be popular items, which are the items mostly sold or viewed. It leaves the [long-tail items](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md) having less chance to get introduced to the users. This is the reason why ALS is not performing as well as a random recommender on diversity metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the algorithmic point of view, items in the tail suffer from the cold-start problem, making them hard for recommendation systems to use. However, from the business point of view, oftentimes the items in the tail can be highly profitable, since, depending on supply, business can apply a higher margin to them. Recommendation systems that optimize metrics like novelty and diversity, can help to find users willing to get these long tail items. Usually there is a trade-off between one type of metric vs. another. One should decide which set of metrics to optimize based on business scenarios."

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The comparision results show that the ALS recommender outperforms the random recommender on ranking metrics (Precision@k, Recall@k, NDCG@k, and\tMean average precision), while the random recommender outperforms ALS recommender on diversity metrics. This is because ALS is optimized for estimating the item rating as accurate as possible, therefore it performs well on accuracy metrics including rating and ranking metrics. As a side effect, the items being recommended tend to be popular items, which are the items mostly sold or viewed. It leaves the long-tail less popular items having less chance to get introduced to the users. This is the reason why ALS is not performing as well as a random recommender on diversity metrics. "
