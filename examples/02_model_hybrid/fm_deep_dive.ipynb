    "\n",
    "Factorization machine (FM) is one of the representative algorithms that are used for building hybrid recommenders model. The algorithm is powerful in terms of capturing the effects of not just the input features but also their interactions. The algorithm provides better generalization capability and expressiveness compared to other classic algorithms such as SVMs. The most recent research extends the basic FM algorithms by using deep learning techniques, which achieve remarkable improvement in a few practical use cases.\n",

The algorithm was original proposed in [\\[1\\]](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf). Traditionally, the algorithms such as SVM do not perform well in dealing with highly sparse data that is usually seen in many contemporary problems, e.g., click-through rate prediction, recommendation, etc. FM handles the problem by modeling not just first-order linear components for predicting the label, but also the cross-product of the feature variables in order to capture more generalized correlation between variables and label.
