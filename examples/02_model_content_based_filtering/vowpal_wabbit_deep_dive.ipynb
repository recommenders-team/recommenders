    "[Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit) is a fast online machine learning library that implements several algorithms relevant to the recommendation use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of Vowpal Wabbit (VW) is that training is done in an online fashion typically using Stochastic Gradient Descent or similar variants, which allows it to scale well to very large datasets. Additionally, it is optimized to run very quickly and can support distributed training scenarios for extremely large datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "VW is best applied to problems where the dataset is too large to fit into memory but can be stored on disk in a single node. Though distributed training is possible with additional setup and configuration of the nodes. The kinds of problems that VW handles well mostly fall into the supervised classification domain of machine learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Multiclass Classification, Support Vector Machines, Simple Neural Nets). It also supports Matrix Factorization approaches and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, as well as a few other algorithms (see the [wiki](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki) for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of a typical deployment use case is a Real Time Bidding scenario, where an auction to place an ad for a user is being decided in a matter of milliseconds. Feature information about the user and items must be extracted and passed into a model to predict likelihood of click (or other interaction) in short order. And if the user and context features are constantly changing (e.g. user browser and local time of day) it may be infeasible to score every possible input combination before hand. This is where VW provides value, as a platform to explore various algorithms offline to train a highly accurate model on a large set of historical data then deploy the model into production so it can generate rapid predictions in real time. Of course this isn't the only manner VW can be deployed, it is also possible to use it entirely online where the model is constantly updating, or use active learning approaches, or work completely offline in a pre-scoring mode.

    "<h3>Vowpal Wabbit for Recommendations</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrate how to use the VW library to generate recommendations on the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several things are worth noting in how VW is being used in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging an Azure Data Science Virtual Machine ([DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/)), VW comes pre-installed and can be used directly from the command line. If you are not using a DSVM you must install vw yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also python bindings to allow VW use within a python environment and even a wrapper conforming to the SciKit-Learn Estimator API. However, the python bindings must be installed as an additional python package with Boost dependencies, so for simplicity's sake execution of VW is done via a subprocess call mimicking what would happen from the command line execution of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "VW expects a specific [input format](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Input-format), in this notebook to_vw() is a convenience function that converts the standard movielens dataset into the required data format. Datafiles are then written to disk and passed to VW for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples shown are to demonstrate functional capabilities of VW not to indicate performance advantages of different approaches. There are several hyper-parameters (e.g. learning rate and regularization terms) that can greatly impact performance of VW models which can be adjusted using [command line options](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Command-Line-Arguments). To properly compare approaches it is helpful to learn about and tune these parameters on the relevant dataset."

    "Currently the userIDs and itemIDs used are integers which means the feature ID is used directly, for instance when user ID 123 rates movie 456, the training example puts a 1 in the values for features 123 and 456. However when interaction is specified (or if a feature is a string) the resulting interaction feature is hashed into the available feature space. Feature hashing is a way to take a very sparse high dimensional feature space and reduce it into a lower dimensional space. This allows for reduced memory while retaining fast computation of feature and model weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The caveat with feature hashing, is that it can lead to hash collisions, where separate features are mapped to the same location. In this case it can be beneficial to increase the size of the space to support interactions between features of high cardinality.

    "\n",
    "As opposed to learning direct weights for specific users, items and interactions when training a regression model, matrix factorization attempts to learn latent factors that determine how a user rates an item. An example of how this might work is if you could represent user preference and item categorization by genre. Given a smaller set of genres we can associate how much each item belongs to each genre class, and we can set weights for a user's preference for each genre. Both sets of weights could be represented as a vectors where the inner product would be the user-item rating. Matrix factorization approaches learn low rank matrices for latent features of users and items such that those matrices can be combined to approximate the original user item matrix.\n",

Compressing the matrix in this way leads to learning generalizable factors which avoids some of the limitations of using regression models with extremely sparse interaction features. This can lead to better convergence and smaller on-disk models.\n",
