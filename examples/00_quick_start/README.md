# Quick Start

In this directory, notebooks are provided to perform a quick demonstration of different algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or Simple Algorithm for Recommendation ([SAR](https://github.com/Microsoft/Product-Recommendations/blob/master/doc/sar.md)). The notebooks show how to establish an end-to-end recommendation pipeline that consists of data preparation, model building, and model evaluation by using the utility functions ([recommenders](../../recommenders)).
