    "# Sequential Recommender Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: SLi_Rec : Adaptive User Modeling with Long and Short-Term Preferences for Personailzed Recommendation\n",
    "Unlike a general recommender such as Matrix Factorization or xDeepFM (in the repo) which doesn't consider the order of the user's activities, sequential recommender systems take the sequence of the user behaviors as context and the goal is to predict the items that the user will interact in a short time (in an extreme case, the item that the user will interact next).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to give you a quick example of how to train a sequential model based on a public Amazon dataset. Currently, we can support NextItNet \\[4\\], GRU4Rec \\[2\\], Caser \\[3\\], A2SVD \\[1\\] and SLi_Rec \\[1\\]. Without loss of generality, this notebook takes [SLi_Rec model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/07/IJCAI19-ready_v1.pdf) for example.\n",
    "SLi_Rec \\[1\\] is a deep learning-based model aims at capturing both long and short-term user preferences for precise recommender systems. To summarize, SLi_Rec has the following key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It adopts the attentive \"Asymmetric-SVD\" paradigm for long-term modeling;\n",
    "* It takes both time irregularity and semantic irregularity into consideration by modifying the gating logic in LSTM.\n",
    "* It uses an attention mechanism to dynamic fuse the long-term component and short-term component.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we test SLi_Rec on a subset of the public dataset: [Amazon_reviews](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Movies_and_TV_5.json.gz) and [Amazon_metadata](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/meta_Movies_and_TV.json.gz)"

In evaluation, the model calculates metrics among the 1+num_ngs instances. For the `predict` function, since we only need to calcuate a socre for each individual instance, there is no need for num_ngs setting.  More details and examples will be provided in the following sections.\n",
