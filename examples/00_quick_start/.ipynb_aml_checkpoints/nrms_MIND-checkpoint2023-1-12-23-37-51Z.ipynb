        "# NRMS: Neural News Recommendation with Multi-Head Self-Attention\n",
        "NRMS \\[1\\] is a neural news recommendation approach with multi-head selfattention. The core of NRMS is a news encoder and a user encoder. In the newsencoder, a multi-head self-attentions is used to learn news representations from news titles by modeling the interactions between words. In the user encoder, we learn representations of users from their browsed news and use multihead self-attention to capture the relatedness between the news. Besides, we apply additive\n",
