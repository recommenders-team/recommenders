    "# RBM Deep Dive with Tensorflow \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we provide a complete walkthrough of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) algorithm with applications to recommender systems. In particular, we use as a case study the [movielens dataset](https://movielens.org), comprising user's ranking of movies on a scale of 1 to 5. A quickstart version of this notebook can be found [here](../00_quick_start/rbm_movielens.ipynb).  \n",

    "### Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a generative neural network model typically used to perform unsupervised learning. The main task of an RBM is to learn the joint probability distribution $P(v,h)$, where $v$ are the visible units and $h$ the hidden ones. The hidden units represent latent variables while the visible units are clamped on the input data. Once the joint distribution is learnt, new examples are generated by sampling from it.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation presented here is based on the article by Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Andriy Mnih and Geoffrey Hinton [Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Collaborative Filtering](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/rbmcf.pdf) with the exception that here we use multinomial units instead of the one-hot encoded used in the paper.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of RBM: \n",
    "\n",
    "The model generates ratings for a user/movie pair using a collaborative filtering based approach. While matrix factorization methods learn how to reproduce an instance of the user/item affinity matrix, the RBM learns its underlying probability distribution. This has several advantages: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Generalizability : the model generalize well to new examples as long as they do not differ much in probability\n",
    "- Stability in time: if the recommendation task is time-stationary, the model does not need to be trained often to accomodate new ratings/users. \n",
    "- The tensorflow implementation presented here allows fast, scalable  training on GPU \n",

    "## 1.1 Overview and main differences with other recommender algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is an undirected graphical model originally devised to study the statistical mechanics (or physics) of magnetic systems. Statistical mechanics (SM) provides a probabilistic description of complex systems made of a huge number of constituents (typically $\\sim 10^{23}$); instead of looking at a particular instance of the system, the aim of SM is to describe their **typical** behaviour. This approach has been succesfull for the description of gases, liquids, complex materials (e.g. semiconductors) and even the famous [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Being designed to handle and organize a large amount of data, SM finds ideal applications in modern learning algorithms. In the context of **recommender systems**, the idea is to learn typical user behaviour instead of particular instances. To better understand this consider the most general setup of a recommendation problem: there are $m$ users rating $n$ items according to some scale (e.g. 1 to 5). In a typical scenario of online shopping, streaming services or decision processes, the user only rates a subset $l \\ll m$ of the products. If we now create a matrix representation of this problem, we obtain the user/item affinity matrix $X$. In a more readable table form, $X$ will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|  $X$   |$i_1$  |$i_2$  |$i_3$  |  ... |$i_m$  | \n",
    "|-----|-------|-------|-------|------|-------|\n",
    "|$u_1$|5      |0      |2      |0 ... |1      |\n",
    "|$u_2$|0      |0      |3      |4 ... |0      |\n",
    "|...  |...    |...    |...    |...   |...    |\n",
    "|$u_m$|3      |3      |0      |5...  |2      |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where the zeroes denote unrated items. In a nutshell, the recommender task is to \"fill in\" the missing ratings (later we will see that in practice this is not the only criteria used to recommend a product). The classical approach to this problem is called matrix factorization: the basic idea is to decompose $X$ into a user ($P$) and item ($Q$) matrix, such that $X = Q^T P$. The dimensions of the two matrices are $dim(Q) = (f, n)$ and $dim(P)= (f,m)$ where $f \\le m,n$ is the number of latent factors, e.g. the genre of a movie, the type of food etc... and it is an hyperparameter of the model, for more details see the [ALS notebook](../02_model/als_deep_dive.ipynb). By learning $Q$ and $P$ we try to reproduce a particular instance of $X$ (provided by the available data) and use this information to fill up the missing matrix elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The RBM approach is to look at $X$ as a particular realization (sample) of a more general process; instead of learning a specific $X$, we try to learn the matrix distribution from which $X$ has been sampled from. Effectively, we learn the typical distribution of *tastes* (i.e. latent factors) and use this information to *generate* new ratings. For this reason, this class of neural network models is also called **generative**. Consider the following example: imagine you are given the  income distribution per age window of a particular country (this is easy to find from goverments data), then we could fix the age window and *generate* virtual citizens with various incomes by sampling from this distibution.

    "The central quantity of every SM model is the [Boltzmann distribution ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution); this can be seen as the least biased probability distribution on a given probability space $\\Sigma$ and can be obtained using a maximum entropy principle on the space of distributions over $\\Sigma$. Its typical form is: \n",

    "$$P = \\frac{1}{Z} \\, e^{- \\beta \\, H},$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z$ is a normalization constant known as the partition function, $\\beta$ is a noise parameter with units of inverse energy and $H$ is the Hamiltonian, or energy function of the system. For this reason, this class of models is also known as *energy based* in computer science. In physics, $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature of the system in units of Boltzmann's constant, but here we will effectively rescale it inside $H$, so that this is now a pure number. $H$ describes the behaviour of two sets of stochastic vectors, typically called $v_i$ (visibles) and $h_j$ (hidden). The former constitute both the input *and* the ouput of the algo (this will be clear later), while the hidden units are the latent factors we want to learn. This structure results in the following Neural Network topology:\n",

    "The input of the movielens database consists of ratings from 1 to 5; we shall thus consider a discrete configuration space of $m$ visible variables, each taking values in a finite set $\\chi_v = \\{ 1, 2, 3,4,5 \\}$. A global configuration of the system is determined by $\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_m) \\in \\chi_v^m$ and we reserve $0$ for an unrated movie. We also need to specify the hidden units, that we take as random binary variables $\\chi_h = \\{0,1 \\}$ denoting if the particular unit is active or not and $\\mathbf{h} = (h_1, h_2, ...,h_n) \\in \\chi_h^n$. The hidden units may describe attributes such as the genre of a movie; for example, given a sci-fi/horror movie, only the hidden units describing such attributes should be active. The minimal model for such a system is defined by the following Hamiltonian: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = - \\sum_{i,j \\in G} v_i \\, w_{ij} \\, h_j - \\sum_{i=1}^m v_i \\, a_i - \\sum_{j=1}^n h_i \\, b_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term is an \"interaction term\", capturing the correlations between the visible and hidden units, while the other two terms are \"potential terms\", taking into account the bias of the units. The correlation matrix $w_{ij}$ and the two biases $a_i$ and $b_i$ are learning parameters to be fixed by the minimization of a properly defined cost function. Remember that this is an unsupervised problem, i.e. there is no real output and therefore we cannot directly minimize the error function between the prediction and the labeled data. As in every SM problem, the right quantity to minimize is the Free energy (remember that $\\beta =1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F =- \\log Z =- \\log \\sum_{ v_i, h_i } P(v, h) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the language of probability theory, the above quantity is the cumulant generating function. One way of evaluating the free energy is to use a [Markov-chain Montecarlo sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Computer_graphics) algorithm such as the Metropolis-Hasting; here we will use instead an approximate method called Contrastive divergence, based on [Gibbs sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling) (see below). The latter has the advantage of being faster than Montecarlo. Once the candidate $F$ has been found, we fix the learning parameters by minimizing $F$. Let us see how this works in practice in the next section. "

Note that the model is trained **only** on the training set, the test set is used to display the test set accuracy of the trained model, that in turn is an estimation of the generazation capabilities of the algorithm. It is generally useful to look at these quantities to have a first idea of the optimization behaviour.  \n",

Once the model has been trained and we are satisfied with its overall accuracy, we sample new ratings from the learned distribution. In particular, we extract the top_k (e.g. 10) most relevant recommendations according to some predefined scorea. The prediction is then returned in a dataframe format ready to be analysed and deployed.  "

You will notice that this is not the case when training the algorithm the second or more times. As for the `minibatch_size`, you would like to choose a value that gives you a good generalization error while mantaining a reasonable running time. The lower the size, the closer you get to stochastic gradient descent, but training takes longer. A big size value (say 1/2 of batch size) will speed up training but will increase the generalization error.     "

    "During training, we evauate the root mean squared error to have an idea of how learning is proceeding. Remember that in the RBM this is not the quantity being minimized, but plotting the rmse per epoch gives us a rough understanding of how learning is proceeding and how we should adjust the hyper parameters. Generally, we would like to see the rmse decrease monotonically as a function of the learning epochs. Even though you may be using an automated hyper parameter optimization method, I strongly suggest to spend some time to manually inspect the learning process; this will give you an idea of the value range to expect for the hyperparameters. Finally, note that most automated hyperparameters search methods are optimized for supervised learning, so they may not work as well for unsupervised tasks. \n",

    "Remember that for a model to generalize well, the difference between train and test metrics should not be too big. In order to visualize these online metrics, choose `with_metrics =True` in the `RBM()` model function. When evaluating metrics, the model takes a bit longer to run, but you need to do so only in the exploratory phase of your work"
