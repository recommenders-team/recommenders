In Layer Combination, we sum over the embeddings at each layer to obtain the final representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Light Graph Convolution (LGC)\n",

    "In LightGCN, the only trainable model parameters are the embeddings at the 0-th layer, i.e., $\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(0)}$ for all users and $\\mathbf{e}_{i}^{(0)}$ for all items.
